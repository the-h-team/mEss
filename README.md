###### myEssentials
a simple-to-use, extensible quality-of-life Spigot plugin.

_Inspired by the work of the [Essentials](https://wiki.mc-ess.net/wiki/Main_Page)
and [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/) projects. We are **not** a fork of
either project but wish to continue the tradition and offer this project as
freely as possible. The source of the complete plugin is thus available for use under the
[GNU General Public License, version 3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/),
just the same as Essentials and EssentialsX._

_Original components licensed variably for use under the terms of the
[GNU General Public License, version 3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/),
[GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/),
and (other license(s) to be determined). See [#1](https://github.com/the-h-team/myEssentials/issues/1)._

_Makes use of the following libraries at runtime:_
* _**[Bukkit/Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/) API**, which mostly follow the GPLv3.0._
* _**[Labyrinth](https://github.com/the-h-team/Labyrinth/)** by [Sanctum](https://github.com/the-h-team); follows LGPLv2.1._

_At this time there are no shaded components; consult the [pom.xml](https://github.com/the-h-team/myEssentials/blob/master/pom.xml) if needed._
